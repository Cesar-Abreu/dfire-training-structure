# D-Fire Dataset Preparation Pipeline 🔥

This repository contains a Google Colab workflow for preparing the **D-Fire dataset** for fire and smoke detection research.

The notebook focuses on:

- Extracting the dataset from Google Drive  
- Organizing images and labels  
- Creating training/validation folder structures  
- Setting up configuration files for future deep learning experiments  

This project was developed as part of an academic Master's dissertation workflow.
